                                    PowerGrip started as a personal project of <b>Andreas P. Hanna</b>,
                                    who later, wanted to share it to all the world as a free, open-source,
                                    application to all the world for personal use.

                                    PowerGrip was built with security in mind.
                                    You login using the application's password to access the
                                    dashboard, but further tasks would require your system account's
                                    password to complete. You might also want to login with
                                    ssh keys instead of the old fashioned password! Did you know that
                                    you can also customize the login methods in the login screen?
