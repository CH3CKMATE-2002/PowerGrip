                                    PowerGrip started as a personal graduation project of <b>CH3CKMATE-2002</b>,
                                    who later, wanted to share it to all the world as a free, open-source,
                                    application to all the world. Nothing compares the joy of seeing your child grow
                                    up, and the happiness of seeing your software becoming popular.

                                    PowerGrip was built with security in mind.
                                    You login using the application's password to access the
                                    dashboard, but further tasks would require your system account's
                                    password to complete. You might also want to login with
                                    ssh keys instead of the old fashioned password! Did you know that
                                    you can also customize the login methods in the login screen?
